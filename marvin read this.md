i have created two routes users and admin.  

open the database unless it wont run which is mongod and press mongodb
then start the server
and go to localhost:3000 to acess the home
go to home then to admin then to login. the admin name is obayuwana. the admin password is paul1997. and go to table

the table alredy has some inbuit in number but i want the user database which has users inside to be displayed in the table to be displayed instead
